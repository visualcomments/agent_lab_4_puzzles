You are writing a solver for the Kaggle competition "CayleyPy Professor Tetraminx Solve Optimally".
Competition page (for reference): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cayley-py-professor-tetraminx-solve-optimally

This repository currently contains a TEMPLATE pipeline for this competition.

Task summary:
- Input: a puzzle state vector (Python list of ints).
- Output: JSON dict with keys "moves" (list of move tokens) and "sorted_array" (final state).

Implementation contract:
- Implement solve(vec) -> (moves, out_vec)
- Provide a CLI entrypoint to print the JSON result, e.g.:
    python solve_module.py "[ ... ]"

If you do not implement a real solver yet, return moves="UNSOLVED" and out_vec=vec.
