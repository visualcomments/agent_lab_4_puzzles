We are solving the CayleyPy Reversals Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cayleypy-reversals

TASK
Write solve_module.py to sort a permutation using ONLY reversal moves:

- R[i,j]: reverse the contiguous segment vec[i..j] inclusive.

INPUT / OUTPUT CONTRACT
- solve(vec) -> (moves, sorted_array)
- moves must be list[str] tokens in the exact format "R[i,j]".
- sorted_array must be the final array after applying moves.
- Script mode prints JSON {"moves":..., "sorted_array":...}

CONSTRAINTS
- No BFS/DFS/A*/graph search.
- No slicing for reversal; use a two-pointer swap loop.
- No built-in sorting.
- Constructive polynomial time.

HINT
For permutations of 0..n-1, you can place value i into position i by one reversal:
  find idx where vec[idx]==i, then apply R[i,idx].
This keeps the prefix 0..i-1 fixed.

Return full python file in one ```python``` block.
