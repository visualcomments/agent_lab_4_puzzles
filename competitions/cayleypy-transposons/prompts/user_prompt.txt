You are writing a solver for the Kaggle competition "CayleyPy Transposons".
Competition page (for reference): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cayleypy-transposons

Task summary (local/offline version used by this repo):
- Input to your solver is a permutation/state vector: a Python list of ints.
- You must output a JSON object with keys:
  - "moves": a list of move tokens (strings)
  - "sorted_array": the resulting state after applying those moves

Moves / generators:
- A move token looks like:  T[i,j,k]
- In this repository you can inspect available generators in:
  competitions/cayleypy-transposons/data/graphs_info.json
  (for each state size it contains "central_state" and a dict of "generators").

Goal:
- Transform the given state into the corresponding "central_state" (the solved state).
- Produce any valid sequence of moves; shorter is better on Kaggle, but correctness is the priority here.

Constraints for this repo's agent pipeline:
- Do NOT use brute-force search over the whole state space.
- Prefer constructive / greedy / polynomial-time methods.
- Avoid Python built-in sorting (sorted / .sort) for the core logic.

Implementation contract:
- Implement solve(vec) -> (moves, out_vec)
  where moves is List[str] and out_vec is List[int].
- Provide a CLI entrypoint so the validator can run:
    python solve_module.py "[ ... ]"
  and print the JSON result to stdout.
