We are solving the CayleyPy V.M. Glushkov permutations problem Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cayleypy-glushkov

TASK
Write solve_module.py to sort a permutation using ONLY these moves:

- L : cyclic left shift by 1 ( [a0,a1,...,a_{n-1}] -> [a1,...,a_{n-1},a0] )
- X : swap positions 0 and 1

INPUT / OUTPUT CONTRACT
- solve(vec) -> (moves, sorted_array)
- moves is a list[str] with tokens only in {"L","X"}
- sorted_array is the final array after applying moves
- Script mode prints JSON {"moves":..., "sorted_array":...}

CONSTRAINTS
- No BFS/DFS/A*/graph search.
- No slicing tricks for L; implement shift with a loop.
- No built-in sorting.
- Constructive polynomial time.

HINT
You can implement an adjacent swap at any index i via conjugation:
  swap(i,i+1) = L^i  X  L^{n-i}
Then use selection sort / insertion sort via repeated adjacent swaps.

Return full python file in one ```python``` block.
