We are solving the CayleyPy Pancake sorting Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/CayleyPy-pancake

TASK
Write a Python module solve_module.py that sorts a permutation using ONLY prefix-reversal moves.

ALLOWED MOVE
- Rk: reverse the first k elements (a "pancake flip"), for 2 <= k <= n.

INPUT / OUTPUT CONTRACT
- The function signature must be: solve(vec) -> (moves, sorted_array)
- vec is a Python list of ints.
- moves must be a list of strings. Each move must be exactly "Rk" where k is an integer.
- sorted_array must be the final array after applying the moves.
- Script mode: python solve_module.py "[3,1,2,0]" must print JSON:
  {"moves": [...], "sorted_array": [...]}

GOAL
After applying all moves to vec, the array must be sorted in nondecreasing order.

STRICT OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
- No BFS/DFS/A*/graph search.
- No slicing tricks for reversing; implement flips with a while-swap loop.
- No built-in sorting (sorted(), list.sort()) to reorder vec.
- Must be constructive polynomial-time.

HINT / CONSTRUCTIVE ALGORITHM
Implement the classic Pancake Sort:
for size = n, n-1, ..., 2:
  find the index of the maximum value in vec[0:size]
  if it is not already at position size-1:
     if index != 0: flip index+1 (R{index+1})
     flip size (R{size})
This sorts in O(n^2) flips.

REQUIRED
Return the full python file in one ```python ...``` block.
