You are writing a solver for the Kaggle competition "CayleyPy 444 Cube Solve Optimally".
Competition page (for reference): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cayley-py-444-cube

Task summary (local/offline version used by this repo):
- Input to your solver is a cube state vector: a Python list of ints (length 96 in this dataset).
- You must output a JSON object with keys:
  - "moves": a list of generator names (strings)
  - "sorted_array": the resulting state after applying those moves

Moves / generators:
- Valid moves are the generator names from:
    competitions/cayley-py-444-cube/data/puzzle_info.json
  under the key "generators".
- Each generator is a permutation of indices. Applying a move permutes the state.

Goal:
- Transform the given state into the "central_state" provided in puzzle_info.json.

Implementation contract:
- Implement solve(vec) -> (moves, out_vec)
  where moves is List[str] and out_vec is List[int].
- Provide a CLI entrypoint so the validator can run:
    python solve_module.py "[ ... ]"
  and print the JSON result to stdout.

Notes:
- Correctness first. On Kaggle, shorter paths score better.
