Task: Implement a constructive sorting algorithm that sorts a given vector using ONLY allowed moves (I, S, K).

Input: A vector a of length n (0-indexed) containing distinct integers.

Allowed moves:
  * **Move I:** Swap the 1st and 2nd elements.
  * **Move S:** Swap all pairs simultaneously: (1st and 2nd), (3rd and 4th), (5th and 6th), etc.
  * **Move K:** Swap all pairs simultaneously: (2nd and 3rd), (4th and 5th), (6th and 7th), etc.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. NO BFS, DFS, or any graph search algorithms are allowed
2. The algorithm must run in POLYNOMIAL TIME (O(n^k) for some constant k)
3. No exponential-time algorithms (like brute force search through permutations)
4. Must use a constructive, iterative approach that builds the solution step by step
5. No storing or exploring multiple states simultaneously

Strict operational constraints:
- No other operations, slicing, built-in sorting functions, or creating new arrays are allowed (except for a copy to simulate sorting)
- All moves must be appended to the moves list immediately after performing them (as strings: "I", "S", or "K")
- Applying the sequence of moves sequentially to a copy of the input vector must yield a fully sorted ascending array
- Moves can be used multiple times as needed

ALGORITHMIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Use a constructive approach: develop a strategy that systematically brings elements to their correct positions
- Think in terms of bringing the smallest unsorted element to the front, then "locking" it in place
- Consider how I and S can help position elements for K swaps
- The solution should work for any n and have predictable, polynomial-time complexity

Expected approach types (choose one):
1. Adaptation of bubble sort/insertion sort using available moves
2. Strategy of bringing smallest element to front, then second smallest, etc.
3. Any other polynomial-time constructive approach

Implementation requirements:
- Implement a function solve(vector) that returns a tuple (moves, sorted_array):
    - moves: list of strings representing all moves performed (e.g., ["I", "S", "K", ...])
    - sorted_array: the final sorted array after applying all moves
- Include CLI interface:
    - When script is executed directly, accept vector as command-line argument (parse sys.argv[1] as JSON)
    - Use [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] as fallback if no arg is given
    - Output should be JSON object with keys "moves" and "sorted_array"
- Include minimal example in main block for quick testing
- Code must be fully self-contained and executable without external dependencies
- JSON output must always be structured and parseable for automated testing

Example usage:
    python solve_module.py "[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]"

Example output:
{
  "moves": ["I", "K"],
  "sorted_array": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}

IMPORTANT: Focus on developing a polynomial-time constructive algorithm, NOT graph search.
